# Genetic Algorithm Implementation
Creating a genetic algorithm in Mojo, leveraging PyTorch for any necessary numerical computations or neural network operations, involves several steps. We'll outline the general structure of such a program, including how to set up the genetic algorithm and integrate PyTorch. Given the nature of Mojo as a superset of Python and its ability to call Python APIs, we can utilize PyTorch directly within Mojo code.

Genetic Algorithm Overview
A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search heuristic inspired by Charles Darwinâ€™s theory of natural evolution. This algorithm reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction to produce the offspring of the next generation.

The key components of GA include:

Population
Fitness Function
Selection
Crossover
Mutation
